Simultaneous - Essentially means we can have licenses exist on the same term.
			   But if any licenses exist at the same time when simultaneous is false,
			   then the carveout won't work.
			   
Spanning     - This just means we will be able to have more than the max customers that was
               specified across different dimensions
			   It's effect on simultaneous is that only within the spanning will simultaneous work.
			   For example, a spanning on Media with max customer 1 and you have two occupying licenses 
			   on Basic and Free respectively would mean that it would be okay.
